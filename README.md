## Installation

### Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/Aayush-garg-131/task-manager.git
cd task-manager

### Install Backend Dependencies
cd server
npm install

### Install Frontend Dependencies
cd ../client
npm install

### Run Backend
cd server
npm run dev
Runs on http://localhost:5000

### Run Frontend

## Deployment

### Frontend
Deployed on Netlify

## Next Steps

Given more time I would add:

- Search tasks by title
- Drag and drop reordering
- Switch storage from JSON file to SQLite
- Jest and Supertest tests for the API routes
- Priority field with colour coded badges

## Learning Resources and References

This project was developed as part of the Studio Graphene Full Stack Developer assessment. During development, I referred to various learning resources including:

- Official React Documentation
- Official Vite Documentation
- Official Express.js Documentation
- Node.js Documentation
- MDN Web Docs

These resources were used to understand concepts, project structure, API development, deployment, and frontend design patterns. The project was implemented, customized, and deployed independently as a hands-on learning exercise. AI tools were used to assist with boilerplate and debugging. All logic is understood and I am prepared to walk through any part of the code in the follow-up interview.
